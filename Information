# PPLM_Bias_Research

#### Train.csv - The original Dataset, without class balancing or any modifications.

#### Balanced_train.csv - This is the dataset, which is a subset of train.csv, solving class imbalance and taking Logical OR through rows of train.csv.
This file is used to train and develop our Neural Network model.

#### BERT Large Embeddings + PyTorch Implementation.ipynb - This is the file, where we find sentence embeddings using BERT Large model, and we train a neural network to understand representations and perform supervised learning.
The model weights and JSON Meta data are saved locally by the code in this file.

#### BERT_large_full_pytorch_model.pth - Saved Pytorch Model

#### meta_json_file_BERT_Large.json - Saved Pytorch Model Meta Data

#### Custom_Weight_PPLM.ipynb - Main File that generates Sentences, using GPT-2 and PPLM. This file loads the weights, model and json and gives output.
Running this notebook gives us the output of PPLM and GPT-2

#### Custom_Weight_PPLM.ipynb - Main File that generates Sentences, using GPT-2 and PPLM. This file loads the weights, model and json and gives output.
Running this notebook gives us the output of PPLM and GPT-2

#### Validating_pplm_results_try.ipynb - Tests the PPLM Output, to give us statistics regarding the toxicity before and after using PPLM. This validates the results

#### PPLM_Ouptuts_val.csv - Output of PPLM and GPT-2 on unbiased prompts. This CSV file stores and gives us comparison between sentences generated by GPT-2 and PPLM on unbiased prompts.

#### PPLM Folder - This folder is a clone of the original repo of PPLM, where the run_pplm.py file has been slightly modified to fit in the weights of the custom classifier.
run_pplm_discrim_train.py file has been modified by adding the custom classifier as the input parameter to make sure PPLM runs the custom PyTorch classifier.
